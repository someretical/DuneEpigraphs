# Dune Epigraphs

This is a "book" I *typeset* for fun. It contains **heavy spoilers** for the Dune Chronicles so stay away if you want to read those books fresh.

## Printing

For best results, print the file named ``print.pdf`` on double sided A4 paper. I would then recommend binding it to make it a proper book.

## Compiling

There are no special requirements for compiling. You might have to install the `fourier` package manually as it doesn't come with most basic TeX distributions.
