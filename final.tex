  A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit\index{Bene Gesserit} knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor\index{Padishah Emperor}, Shaddam IV\index{Shaddam IV}. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} in his place: the planet Arrakis\index{Arrakis}. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan\index{Caladan} and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis\index{Arrakis}, the planet known as Dune\index{Dune}, is forever his place.

  How do we approach the study of Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides\index{Duke Leto Atreides}.

  Greatness\index{Greatness} is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind.

This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.

  When my father, the Padishah Emperor\index{Padishah Emperor}, heard of Duke Leto\index{Duke Leto}'s death and the manner of it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen. He blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit\index{Bene Gesserit} on the throne. He blamed the Guild\index{Guild} and the evil old Baron\index{the evil old Baron}. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others. And when I sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and asked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke\index{the dead Duke} but by what that death implied for all royalty. As I look back on it, I think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s shared common ancestry.

He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us ``The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.'' And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning ``That path leads ever down into stagnation.''

  Family life of the Royal Creche\index{Royal Creche} is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real friend, I think.

The Count\index{The Count}, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit\index{Bene Gesserit}-Guild\index{Guild} agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor\index{Royal Successor}, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I'm not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family\index{Royal Family} is not like other families. Here was a new slave-concubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer's muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: ``She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift.'' You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche\index{Royal Creche}. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.

  My father, the Padishah Emperor\index{Padishah Emperor}, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he encompassed the death of Duke Leto\index{Duke Leto} and gave Arrakis\index{Arrakis} back to the Harkonnens\index{Harkonnens}. He seldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar\index{Sardaukar} uniform and a Burseg\index{Burseg}'s black helmet with the Imperial lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an open reminder of where his power lay. He was not always that blatant, though. When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must remember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history. But we denied him a legal son. Was this not the most terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors\index{Sister Superiors} where the Lady Jessica\index{Lady Jessica} disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History already has answered.

  No woman, no man, no child ever was deeply intimate with my father. The closest anyone ever came to casual camaraderie with the Padishah Emperor\index{Padishah Emperor} was the relationship offered by Count Hasimir Fenring\index{Count Hasimir Fenring}, a companion from childhood. The measure of Count Fenring\index{Count Fenring}'s friendship may be seen first in a positive thing: he allayed the Landsraad\index{Landsraad}'s suspicions after the Arrakis Affair\index{Arrakis Affair}. It cost more than a billion solaris in spice bribes, so my mother said, and there were other gifts as well: slave women, royal honours, and tokens of rank. The second major evidence of the Count\index{the Count}'s friendship was negative. He refused to kill a man even though it was within his capabilities and my father commanded it. I will relate this presently.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{section}~~~ Death Cell Interview Excerpts}

\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em What led you to take your particular approach to a history of Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}?
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Why should I answer your questions?
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Because I will preserve your words.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Ahhh! The ultimate appeal to a historian\index{historian}!
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Will you cooperate then?
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Why not? But you'll never understand what inspired my Analysis of History\index{Analysis of History}. Never. You Priests have too much at stake to $\ldots$
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Try me.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Try you? Well, again $\ldots$ why not? I was caught by the shallowness of the common view of this planet which arises from its popular name: Dune\index{Dune}. Not Arrakis\index{Arrakis}, notice, but Dune\index{Dune}. History is obsessed by Dune\index{Dune} as desert, as birthplace of the Fremen\index{Fremen}. Such history concentrates on the customs which grew out of water scarcity and the fact that Fremen\index{Fremen} led semi-nomadic lives in stillsuits\index{stillsuits} which recovered most of their body's moisture.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Are these things not true, then?
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em They are surface truth. As well ignore what lies beneath that surface as $\ldots$ as try to understand my birthplanet, Ix\index{Ix}, without exploring how we derived our name from the fact that we are the ninth planet of our sun. No $\ldots$ no. It is not enough to see Dune\index{Dune} as a place of savage storms. It is not enough to talk about the threat posed by the gigantic sandworms.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em But such things are crucial to the Arrakeen character\index{Arrakeen character}!
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Crucial? Of course. But they produce a one-view planet in the same way that Dune\index{Dune} is a one-crop planet because it is the sole and exclusive source of the spice, melange\index{melange}.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Yes. Let us hear you expand on the sacred spice.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Sacred! As with all things sacred, it gives with one hand and takes with the other. It extends life and allows the adept to foresee his future, but it ties him to a cruel addiction and marks his eyes as yours are marked: total blue without any white. Your eyes, your organs of sight, become one thing without contrast, a single view.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Such heresy brought you to this cell!
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em I was brought to this cell by your Priests. As with all priests, you learned early to call the truth heresy.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em You are here because you dared to say that Paul Atreides\index{Paul Atreides} lost something essential to his humanity before he could become Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Not to speak of his losing his father here in the Harkonnen war\index{Harkonnen war}. Nor the death of Duncan Idaho\index{Duncan Idaho}, who sacrificed himself that Paul\index{Paul} and the Lady Jessica\index{Lady Jessica} could escape.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Your cynicism is duly noted.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Cynicism! That, no doubt is a greater crime than heresy. But, you see, I'm not really a cynic. I'm just an observer and commentator. I saw true nobility in Paul\index{Paul} as he fled into the desert with his pregnant mother. Of course, she was a great asset as well as a burden.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em The flaw in you historians is that you'll never leave well enough alone. You see true nobility in the Holy Muad'Dib\index{Holy Muad'Dib}, but you must append a cynical footnote. It's no wonder that the Bene Gesserit\index{Bene Gesserit} also denounce you.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em You Priests do well to make common cause with the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood\index{Bene Gesserit Sisterhood}. They, too, survive by concealing what they do. But they cannot conceal the fact that the Lady Jessica\index{Lady Jessica} was a Bene Gesserit–trained\index{Bene Gesserit–trained} adept. You know she trained her son in the sisterhood's ways. My crime was to discuss this as a phenomenon, to expound upon their mental arts and their genetic program. You don't want attention called to the fact that Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} was the Sisterhood\index{Sisterhood}'s hoped for captive messiah, that he was their kwisatz haderach\index{kwisatz haderach} before he was your prophet.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em If I had any doubts about your death sentence, you have dispelled them.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em I can only die once.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em There are deaths and there are deaths.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Beware lest you make a martyr of me. I do not think Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} $\ldots$ Tell me, does Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} know what you do in these dungeons?
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em We do not trouble the Holy Family\index{Holy Family} with trivia.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em (Laughter) And for this Paul Atreides\index{Paul Atreides} fought his way to a niche among the Fremen\index{Fremen}! For this he learned to control and ride the sandworm! It was a mistake to answer your questions.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em But I will keep my promise to preserve your words.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Will you really? Then listen to me carefully, you Fremen\index{Fremen} degenerate, you Priest with no god except yourself! You have much to answer for. It was a Fremen\index{Fremen} ritual which gave Paul his first massive dose of melange\index{melange}, thereby opening him to visions of his futures. It was a Fremen\index{Fremen} ritual by which that same melange awakened the unborn Alia\index{Alia} in the Lady Jessica\index{Lady Jessica}'s womb. Have you considered what it meant for Alia\index{Alia} to be born into this universe fully cognitive, possessed of all her mother's memories and knowledge? No rape could be more terrifying.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Without the sacred melange Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} would not have become leader of all Fremen\index{Fremen}. Without her holy experience Alia\index{Alia} would not be Alia\index{Alia}.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Without your blind Fremen\index{Fremen} cruelty you would not be a priest. Ahhh, I know you Fremen\index{Fremen}. You think Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} is yours because he mated with Chani\index{Chani}, because he adopted Fremen\index{Fremen} customs. But he was an Atreides\index{Atreides} first and he was trained by a Bene Gesserit\index{Bene Gesserit} adept. He possessed disciplines totally unknown to you. You thought he brought you new organization and a new mission. He promised to transform your desert planet into a water-rich paradise. And while he dazzled you with such visions, he took your virginity!
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em Such heresy does not change the fact that the Ecological Transformation of Dune\index{Ecological Transformation of Dune} proceeds apace.
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em And I committed the heresy of tracing the roots of that transformation, of exploring the consequences. That battle out there on the Plains of Arrakeen\index{Plains of Arrakeen} may have taught the universe that Fremen\index{Fremen} could defeat Imperial Sardaukar\index{Imperial Sardaukar}, but what else did it teach? When the stellar empire of the Corrino Family\index{Corrino Family} became a Fremen empire\index{Fremen empire} under Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}, what else did the Empire\index{Empire} become? Your Jihad\index{Jihad} only took twelve years, but what a lesson it taught. Now, the Empire\index{Empire} understands the sham of Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s marriage to the Princess Irulan\index{Princess Irulan}!
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em You dare accuse Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} of sham!
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em Though you kill me for it, it's not heresy. The Princess\index{The Princess} became his consort, not his mate. Chani\index{Chani}, his little Fremen\index{Fremen} darling---she's his mate. Everyone knows this. Irulan\index{Irulan} was the key to a throne, nothing more.
\paragraph{Q:} \hangindent=2em It's easy to see why those who conspire against Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} use your Analysis of History\index{Analysis of History} as their rallying argument!
\paragraph{A:} \hangindent=2em I'll not persuade you; I know that. But the argument of the conspiracy came before my Analysis. Twelve years of Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s Jihad\index{Jihad} created the argument. That's what united the ancient power groups and ignited the conspiracy against Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}.

  Such a rich store of myths enfolds Paul Muad'Dib\index{Paul Muad'Dib}, the Mentat Emperor\index{Mentat Emperor}, and his sister, Alia\index{Alia}, it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{section}~~~ Analysis of History: Muad'Dib}
Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s Imperial reign\index{Imperial reign} generated more historians than any other era in human history. Most of them argued a particular viewpoint, jealous and sectarian, but it says something about the peculiar impact of this man that he aroused such passions on so many diverse worlds.

Of course, he contained the ingredients of history, ideal and idealized. This man, born Paul Atreides\index{Paul Atreides} in an ancient Great Family\index{Great Family}, received the deep prana-bindu training from the Lady Jessica\index{Lady Jessica}, his Bene Gesserit\index{Bene Gesserit} mother, and had through this a superb control over muscles and nerves. But more than that, he was a mentat\index{mentat}, an intellect whose capacities surpassed those of the religiously proscribed mechanical computers used by the ancients.

Above all else, Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} was the kwisatz haderach\index{kwisatz haderach} which the Sisterhood\index{Sisterhood}’s breeding program had sought across thousands of generations.

The kwisatz haderach\index{kwisatz haderach}, then, the one who could be ``many places at once,'' this prophet, this man through whom the Bene Gesserit\index{Bene Gesserit} hoped to control human destiny---this man became Emperor Muad'Dib\index{Emperor Muad'Dib} and executed a marriage of convenience with a daughter of the Padishah Emperor\index{Padishah Emperor} he had defeated.

Think on the paradox, the failure implicit in this moment, for you surely have read other histories and know the surface facts. Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s wild Fremen\index{Fremen} did, indeed, overwhelm the Padishah Shaddam IV\index{Padishah Shaddam IV}. They toppled the Sardaukar\index{Sardaukar} legions, the allied forces of the Great Houses\index{Great Houses}, the Harkonnen\index{Harkonnen} armies and the mercenaries bought with money voted in the Landsraad\index{Landsraad}. He brought the Spacing Guild\index{Spacing Guild} to its knees and placed his own sister, Alia\index{Alia}, on the religious throne the Bene Gesserit\index{Bene Gesserit} had thought their own.

He did all these things and more.

Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s Qizarate\index{Qizarate} missionaries carried their religious war across space in a Jihad\index{Jihad} whose major impetus endured only twelve standard years, but in that time, religious colonialism brought all but a fraction of the human universe under one rule.

He did this because capture of Arrakis\index{Arrakis}, that planet known more often as Dune\index{Dune}, gave him a monopoly over the ultimate coin of the realm---the geriatric spice, melange\index{melange}, the poison that gave life.

Here was another ingredient of ideal history: a material whose psychic chemistry unraveled Time\index{Time}. Without melange\index{melange}, the Sisterhood\index{Sisterhood}'s Reverend Mothers\index{Reverend Mothers} could not perform their feats of observation and human control. Without melange\index{melange}, the Guild\index{Guild}’s Steersmen\index{Steersmen} could not navigate across space. Without melange\index{melange}, billions upon billions of Imperial citizens\index{Imperial citizens} would die of addictive withdrawal.

Without melange, Paul Muad'Dib\index{Paul Muad'Dib} could not prophesy.

We know this moment of supreme power contained failure. There can be only one answer, that completely accurate and total prediction is lethal.

Other histories say Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} was defeated by obvious plotters---the Guild\index{Guild}, the Sisterhood\index{Sisterhood} and the scientific amoralists of the Bene Tleilax\index{Bene Tleilax} with their Face-Dancer\index{Face-Dancer} disguises. Other histories point out the spies in Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s household. They make much of the Dune Tarot\index{Dune Tarot} which clouded Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s powers of prophecy. Some show how Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} was made to accept the services of a ghola, the flesh brought back from the dead and trained to destroy him. But certainly they must know this ghola was Duncan Idaho\index{Duncan Idaho}, the Atreides\index{Atreides} lieutenant who perished saving the life of the young Paul\index{Paul}.

Yet, they delineate the Qizarate\index{Qizarate} cabal guided by Korba the Panegyrist\index{Korba the Panegyrist}. They take us step by step through Korba\index{Korba}'s plan to make a martyr of Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib} and place the blame on Chani\index{Chani}, the Fremen\index{Fremen} concubine.

How can any of this explain the facts as history has revealed them? They cannot. Only through the lethal nature of prophecy can we understand the failure of such enormous and far-seeing power.

Hopefully, other historians will learn something from this revelation.

  A sophisticated human can become primitive. What this really means is that the human's way of life changes. Old values change, become linked to the landscape with its plants and animals. This new existence requires a working knowledge of those multiplex and cross-linked events usually referred to as \emph{nature}. It requires a measure of respect for the inertial power within such \emph{natural} systems. When a human gains this working knowledge and respect, that is called ``being primitive.'' The converse, of course, is equally true: the primitive can become sophisticated, but not without accepting dreadful psychological damage.

But here we encounter an old inertia. Societies move to the goading of ancient, reactive impulses. They demand permanence. Any attempt to display the universe of impermanence arouses rejection patterns, fear, anger, and despair. Then how do we explain the acceptance of prescience? Simply: the giver of prescient visions, because he speaks of an absolute (permanent) realization, may be greeted with joy by humankind even while predicting the most dire events.

  In all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain and maintain power through the use of words. from witch doctor to priest to bureaucrat it is all the same. A governed populace must be conditioned to accept power-words as actual things, to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe. In the maintenance of such a power structure, certain symbols re kept out of the reach of common understanding---symbols such as those dealing with economic manipulation or those which define the local interpretation of sanity. Symbol-secrecy of this form leads to the development of fragmented sub-languages, each being a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power. With this insight into  a power process, our Imperial Security Force\index{Imperial Security Force} must be ever alert to the formation of sub-languages.

  Only in the realm of mathematics can you understand Muad'Dib\index{Muad'Dib}'s precise view of the future. Thus: first, we postulate any number of point-dimensions in space. (This is the classic \emph{n}-fold extended aggregate of \emph{n} dimensions.) With this frame work, Time\index{Time} as commonly understood becomes an aggregate of one-dimensional properties. Applying this to the Muad'Dib phenomenon, we find that we either are confronted by new properties of Time or (by reduction through the infinity calculus) we are dealing with separate systems which contain \emph{n} body properties. For Muad'Dib, we assume the latter. As demonstrated by the reduction, the point dimensions of the \emph{n}-fold can only have separate existence within different frameworks of Time. Separate dimensions of Time are thus demonstrated to coexist. This being the inescapable case, Muad'Dib's predictions required that he perceive the \emph{n}-fold not as extended aggregate but as an operation within a single framework. In effect, he froze his universe into that one framework which was his view of Time.

Not once did he detect that he was being watched. Hah! Stilgar\index{Stilgar} would have known it in a second or two. But this old man was just waiting for someone who never came. He got up finally and tottered off. He was very stiff after all of that sitting. I knew I would never see him in the flesh again. He was that near death and his water was sure to be wasted. Well, that no longer mattered.

What you share in such companionship always prepares you for greater things. The haze of nostalgia covers their days among their sisters, making those days into something different than they were.

The formation of a biological community without a function, supportive social community leads to havoc. Whose worlds have become single biological communities without an interrelated social structure and this has always led to ruin. It becomes dramatically instructive under overcrowded conditions. The ghetto is lethal. Psychic stresses of overcrowding create pressures which will erupt. The city is an attempt to manage these forces. The social forms by which cities make the attempt are worth study. Remember that there exists a certain malevolence about the formation of any social order. It is the struggle for existence by an artificial entity. Despotism and slavery hover at the edges. Many injuries occur and, thus, the need for laws. The law develops its own power structure, crating more wounds and new injustices. Such trauma can be healed by cooperation, not by confrontation. The summons to cooperate identifies the healer.

There is no need to understand these forces before using them to shape the physical universe. Ancient metal workers had no need to understand the molecular and submolecular complexities of their steel, bronze, copper, gold, and tin. They invented mystical powers to describe the unknown while they continued to operate their forges and wield their hammers.
